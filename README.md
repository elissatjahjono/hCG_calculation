ELISA at 450 nm, background at 620-630 nm. First input is absorbance readings for hCG standards (0, 5, 25, 50, 100, and 200 mIU/mL). Second input is a table with 'Abs' column containing absorbance values (450 - background) for the samples. Output is a table with the corresponding hCG concentration.
